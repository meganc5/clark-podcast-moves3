# Common moves in podcasting: 


## Here are the podcasts I listened to:

In the car ride to Ohio, I listened to entertainment/comedy podcasts. Here is what I have to say about them:  

<b> Rose Buddies: </b>

This is a fun podcast. It's a husband/wife duo. Rachel and Griffen are big <i> Bachelor </i> fans, and self-proclaimed entertainment experts. Even though I don't watch the show, this podcast is still super easy to follow and super funny. I enjoy this podcast.

<b> My Brother, My Brother, and Me: </b>

This podcast is again, silly (I should probably work on a more descriptive word than "silly"). Continuing with the comedy theme here, this podcast is three brothers answering questions and giving "advice" to questions that are sent in. None of it is very serious. Just a bunch of funny dudes.


## notes on "moves" derived from these podcasts:

- <b> genre: </b> entertainment (also super funny/silly). The entertainment podcasts I listened to for this assignment are entertainment based, with <i> very </i> little practical application or information derived, the true purpose is to entertain the listener.For example, <i> The Bachelor </i> is probably one of the most mindless shows on television. So this couple that makes jokes about the show and re-hashes it is clearly for entertainment's sake. However, podcasts are a useful medium in they easily cut across multiple genres.

- <b> organization: </b> Both of these podcasts are set up in what seems to be kind of a classic "podcast-y" way.

  - podcast-ers introduce themselves, say what they are going to talk about.
  - jingle (for both of the podcasts I watch, they play the same song in each episode)
  - topic 1:
  - topic 2:
  - topic 3:
  - closing: They say "thanks!" and mention what the next show will be about.
  - jingle again


- <b> style: </b> Podcasts come with a lot of cool sound effects, for example, in " My Brother, My Brother, and Me" they used a clip of phone ringing for a joke, and used several other sound effects semi-frequently though the show. How often a podcast does this sort of thing can help establish the style of the show. The other podcast I studied for this assignment, Rose Buddies, did not use sound effects. By doing this, the audience is pays a little more attention to the couple as they talk.

- <b> narrative types: </b> There's a lot of ways that podcasts can go about their narratives. In the podcasts I talked about, the speakers primarily narrated their own scripts, and 'My Brother, My Brother, and Me", sometimes brings in another person to interview. However, another one of my favorite podcasts, "99% Invisible" largely mixes interviews, narration, and other features. Because "99% Invisible" tends to have a more informative genre than the others I studied for this assignment, it was helpful in order to establish a more compete view of the topics.
